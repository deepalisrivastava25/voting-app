# VotingApplication

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project is a demo Voting Application that consists of 3 sections:
1. Creating question for voting - First section.
2. Add your vote by selecting either of the options - Second section.
3. Seeing the voting results by bar chart dynamically changing values - Third section.

Initially only the first section is visible, and you have to save question in order to see the second section. 
Once the second section is visible, you can vote by selecting an option to see the chart in third section.

This is how the page looks like after creating a vote question and then voting to it.
